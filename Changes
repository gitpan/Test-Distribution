Revision history for Perl extension Test::Distribution.

1.04  Sat Jul 12 22:57:00 BST 2003
        - Changed to use Test::Pod 0.95 and pod_file_ok function
          instead of pod_ok to prevent deprecation warnings
          (Sagar Shah)

	- added a named argument 'not' to ask not to do certain types of tests
	- added test type 'prereq' that checks whether all non-provided
	  non-core use()d files are in Makefile.PL's PREREQ_PM
	- added test type 'description' that checks whether Changes,
	  README, MANIFEST and Makefile.PL exist
	- added checking for required modules with eval{} so we can skip
	  tests if necessary (thanks petdance)
	- changed munging of file and directory names from regexes to
	  use File::Spec, to be portable
