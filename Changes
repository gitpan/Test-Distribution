Revision history for Perl extension Test::Distribution.

1.10	- Updated TODO

1.09    - Added missing Test::Signature to requires hash in Build.PL
	- Added missing SKIP block to Test::Distribution::sig::run_tests

1.08    - Updated example of 01distribution.t with code that doesn't
          cause testing of the module to fail if user does not have
          Test::Distribtion installed. This is good because it means
          module authors who do not want to force their users to install
          Test::Distribution and all of its dependencies do not have to
        - Added support for sig testing via Test::Signature

1.07	- Minor POD Updates
	- Description  tests now allow  no  Makefile.PL if you have a
	  Build.PL.  However    this   does  not  mean   Module::Build
	  support.  You  still  need   a  Makefile.PL to  prevent  the
	  PREREQ_PM tests     failing. Module::Build    support   will
	  hopefully follow in a future version.

1.06 	- New Maintainer/Owner: Sagar R. Shah
     	- Moved from ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Module::Build for building
	- Tests are now run in a specific order (stops Test::Distribution trying to evaluate $VERSION before doing a use)
        - All non-core use()d modules test now has a proper test name
	- Thanks to David A Golden for the patch

        - Testing PREREQ_PM relies on Module::CoreList which, even at
          the current version, doesn't know about perl 5.8.1 yet.  So in
          the meantime, I've added a simple check to skip PREREQ_PM testing
          if $Module::CoreList::version{ $] } doesn't exist (thanks
          Randal L. Schwartz and Richard Clamp).
        - Testing PREREQ_PM now outputs an easy-to-understand error message
          if necessary. Previously I just used Test::More's is(), which
          didn't say what the test was about, just that two strings didn't
          match.

1.04  Sat Jul 12 22:57:00 BST 2003
        - Changed to use Test::Pod 0.95 and pod_file_ok function
          instead of pod_ok to prevent deprecation warnings
          (thanks Sagar Shah)

1.03  Sat Sep  7 11:37:25 CEST 2002
	- added a named argument 'not' to ask not to do certain types of tests
	- added test type 'prereq' that checks whether all non-provided
	  non-core use()d files are in Makefile.PL's PREREQ_PM
	- added test type 'description' that checks whether Changes,
	  README, MANIFEST and Makefile.PL exist
	- added checking for required modules with eval{} so we can skip
	  tests if necessary (thanks petdance)
	- changed munging of file and directory names from regexes to
	  use File::Spec, to be portable

1.02  Mon Sep  2 23:26:01 CEST 2002
	- changed the name to Test::Distribution as per Andy Lester's
	  suggestion and updated docs.

1.01  Mon Sep  2 23:26:01 CEST 2002
	- added named arguments ('tests', 'only') and reflection subs
	  (packages(), files(), num_tests()), and docs for the same.

1.00  Mon Sep  2 15:40:21 2002
	- ideas by Andy Lester and brian d foy (see
	  http://use.perl.org/~brian_d_foy/journal/7463)
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-XAn Test::Comprehensive
